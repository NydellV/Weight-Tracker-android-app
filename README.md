# Weight-Tracker-android-app


I created a weight tracking app to help users manaage and view their progress of their weight daily. My overall goal for the app was to keep it simple and organized making it easy for the user. 
In the app i created a enter your weight button that allowed the user to input their weight. i also had features to edit or delete the info that the user entered.
i think my designs were pretty successful being that it was really sleek and simple for the user. everything in my app was pretty straightforeward. 
when i begin coding my project i broke each tasks into tasks i needed to complete daily. this helped me a lot to make progress in the app and to avoid burnout during coding.
this strategy helped me stay on track which i would say is somethinig i would be able to use in future projects to stay organized and on track.
another strategy i would keep using in the future is to test the code a lot during the process to make sure that there is no new bugs while you are adding or updating the code.
i consistantly ran into bugs im the syntax while i was adding a new button feature in my app. 
a challenge i faced during my project was having to figure out how to allow the user to edit their weight and the date if needeed. 
i had the edit button already in the layout.xml but creating the code for it is where i struggled.
In the end this project really helped me build a solid understanding on mobile app development. 
i was able to practice java and really push myself out of my comfort zone during this project.
